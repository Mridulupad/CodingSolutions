Given a string and an int n, return a string made of the first n characters of the string, followed by the first n-1 characters of the string, and so on. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive (i.e. n >= 0 and n <= str.length()).


repeatFront("Chocolate", 4) → "ChocChoChC"
repeatFront("Chocolate", 3) → "ChoChC"
repeatFront("Ice Cream", 2) → "IcI"

//MY SOLUTION

public String repeatFront(String str, int n) {
  String inclusive="";
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
     inclusive=inclusive+str.charAt(i);
  }
  for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
     inclusive=inclusive+inclusive.substring(0,i);
  }
  return  inclusive;
}
